Objective: Make a "Main Menu" for the various programs I have written.

On startup: Display startup animation, then prompt for a program selection.
Programs will be chosen based on the button pressed on the keypad.

1: Dodge game
2: Character debugger
3: Coin toss Rhythm game
4: MP3 Player (not yet implemented)
5: EPIC Player
6: Clock (not yet implemented)
7: Billboard (not yet implemented)
8: "Timer" (sounds very much like a bomb) (partial code available)
9: Credits (Literally just me)
0: Settings (not yet implemented)

*: Gives info for any above program
#: Shutdown (Plays shutdown animation, then DIES)

Requirements:
1. Figure out a way to dispatch to programs without using hardware twice
2. Have settings that transfer between programs
